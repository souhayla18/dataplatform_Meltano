# 🛠️ Data Mesh Project: Local Data Platform

This project demonstrates the implementation of a **Data Mesh** architecture using local tools like **Docker**, **Meltano**, **DBT**, and **DuckDB**. It focuses on building a scalable, modular data platform to handle the ETL process, data transformation, and scheduling tasks, while incorporating key concepts such as **Data Mesh**, **Data Lake**, **Data Store**, and **Data Marts**.

## 📐 Project Architecture

The architecture of this data platform follows the principles of **Data Mesh**, focusing on decentralization of data ownership and management. The platform is structured into multiple domains (e.g., Sales, Marketing) with isolated Docker containers to handle different processes.

### Architecture Breakdown

![Project Architecture](assets/project-architecture.png)

#### Key Components:
- **Docker Setup**: The foundation of this project, which runs **Meltano** for ETL processes and **DBT** for data transformations in isolated containers.
- **Meltano**: Manages the Extract, Load, and Transform (ELT) tasks. It extracts raw data, loads it into DuckDB, and allows for future transformations.
- **DBT (Data Build Tool)**: Handles the data transformations and modeling. Data is transformed in the **Silver layer** (processed/cleaned) and then aggregated into the **Gold layer** (ready for analysis).
- **Data Mesh Principles**: Decentralized data ownership across domains, improving data governance, security, and accessibility.
- **Data Lake (Bronze Layer)**: Raw data storage in DuckDB.
- **Data Store (Silver Layer)**: Transformed and cleaned data stored in DuckDB, ready for further analysis.
- **Data Marts (Gold Layer)**: Aggregated and enriched data for analysis and reporting.

## 🚀 Why This Project?

This project was designed to demonstrate the importance and benefits of using **Data Mesh** in modern data architectures. Traditional centralized data warehouses can become bottlenecks and lead to inefficient data management, especially when scaling. A **Data Mesh** decentralizes the data architecture, allowing each domain to take ownership of its data, making it more scalable, flexible, and aligned with business needs.

### Key Benefits of Data Mesh:
- **Scalability**: By decentralizing data ownership, Data Mesh allows organizations to scale more easily across different domains.
- **Improved Data Governance**: Each domain has full control over its data, ensuring quality, security, and lineage.
- **Flexibility**: Data processing and transformation are handled independently per domain, making the system adaptable and resilient to change.
- **Faster Insights**: By building a more modular system, data can be processed and analyzed more quickly.

## ⚙️ Project Setup

Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine:

### Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following tools installed on your local machine:

- **[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)**: Containerization tool for running services in isolated environments.
- **[Meltano](https://www.meltano.com/docs/installation/)**: Tool for managing ELT pipelines.
- **[DBT](https://docs.getdbt.com/dbt-cli/installation)**: Tool for data transformation and modeling.
- **Python** (Optional): For task automation using cron jobs or Python scheduling.

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/data-mesh-project.git
cd data-mesh-project  ```
Set Up Docker Environment
Build Docker Containers: Inside your project folder, use Docker Compose to build the containers for Meltano and DBT.

bash
Copy code
docker-compose up --build
Start Containers: Once the build completes, start the containers:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose up
This will run the Meltano and DBT containers, allowing them to communicate with each other and process the data.
Set Up Task Automation
Cron Jobs (Optional): If you wish to automate ETL tasks (e.g., extracting data with Meltano, transforming data with DBT), you can set up cron jobs or use Python's scheduling library. Here’s an example of a cron job setup:

bash
Copy code
# Edit crontab file
crontab -e

# Add a cron job to run Meltano extraction every day at midnight
0 0 * * * /usr/local/bin/meltano elt <your_extraction_pipeline>

🔧 Step-by-Step Guide to Deploy
1. Set up Docker for Meltano and DBT
Follow the Docker setup instructions above to build the containers and manage their orchestration with Docker Compose.

2. Configure Meltano
Edit the meltano.yml file to specify your data sources and pipelines for ELT tasks (extract, load, transform).

3. Configure DBT
Edit the DBT profiles.yml file to configure the connection to DuckDB and define your transformation models. Place transformation SQL files in the models/ folder.

4. Set Up Task Scheduling
Use cron jobs or Python scripts to automate the scheduling of your Meltano ETL tasks and DBT transformations. The scripts/ directory contains sample scripts to help you get started.

5. Test the Flow
Test the entire pipeline from data extraction to transformation and aggregation. Ensure data is flowing through the Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers.

6. Deploy and Monitor
Once the system is set up, monitor the performance and adjust the architecture for scaling as needed.

🎯 Conclusion
This project provides a hands-on demonstration of implementing a Data Mesh architecture using local tools. The architecture ensures scalability, flexibility, and improved data governance by decentralizing data ownership and processing. This approach is well-suited for organizations looking to scale their data systems while maintaining high data quality and security.
